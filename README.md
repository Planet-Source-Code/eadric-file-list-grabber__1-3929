## File List Grabber


</div>

### Description

With this program you can easily make a searchable list of files with size included. This is great for people with large numbers of files (like say mp3's) who don't want to duplicate their already downloaded files. Simply drag and Drop files onto the listbox. You can save and retrieve the filelist to a text file for future use. Also provided is a MRU or Most Recently Used list, so that you don't have to search for the file everytime you want to load it. Full source code is included (of course), so you can see how it all works!
 
### More Info
 
Files dropped onto the listbox.

I couldn't find any source code for making a MRU list, so I had to come up with my own. I've fully tested it for reliability and have found no bugs whatsoever.

The search function I use is a bit slow, but with some work, it could be greatly improved.

The file list is saved in text format, so you can easily import it into any wordprocessor or post it on the web.
